<h1>CS2 - The Ultimate Pistol Round Guide</h1>

<h2>1. What to buy?</h2>

<p>Here are your options:</p>
<p>- Buy armour (and optionally a decoy)</p>
<p>- Buy a better pistol and some util</p>
<p>- Buy a full $800 worth of util or util + kit (CT)</p>
<p>$800 cannot buy you a full set of util, so you would have to choose wisely as there are many combinations with different pros and cons.</p>
<p>Most commonly, people buy armour.</p>
<p><u>ARMOUR</u></p>
<p>Both sides' starting pistols have very low armour penetration, meaning you would take less damage if you have it.
<p>It takes 8 bullets from a glock to kill someone with armour (to the chest). This is double the amount it takes without armour. (4 to the chest, 3 to the stomach/lower torso). It takes 3 bullets to the chest kill someone WITHOUT armour with a USP, whereas it takes 6 WITH armour. </p>
<p>Aim punch (where your camera moves up when you get shot) is very bad without armour. </p>
<p>How to tell when someone does or does not have armour:</p>
<p>- When you shoot someone WITH armour, it sounds like a dull thud. When you shoot someone WITHOUT armour, it sounds more fleshy. This isn't super important but can still be useful. </p>
<p>- When they have a better pistol. This might not be fully true as someone can pick up a pistol after buying armour but generally, they wouldnt have unless it is late in the round. </p>
<br></br>
<p><u>UTILITY</u></p>
<p>Pros and Cons of buying different sets of utility (excluding the obvious Con of no armour and sometimes no better pistol):</p>
<p>- Grenade + Molotov</p>
<p>Pros: Both deal damage to enemies, cut off areas for short periods of time, can kill damaged players hiding in corners.
<p>Cons: $100 left on T, $0 left on CT, can both often be wasted and do no damage, or could be lost and given to enemy team if you try to save them but die.
<br></br>
<p>- Smoke + Grenade</p>
<p>Pros: Can do damage, cut off an area, can use the HE to blow open the smoke to get a few surprise kills, can kill damaged players, $200 left.</p>
<p>Cons: HE can often be wasted and do no damage, smokes are valuable so can be picked up by enemies upon death.</p>
<br></br>
<p>- Smoke + Flashbang</p>
<p>Pros: Can blind enemies, cut off an area, $300 left, Flashes are not the most desired piece of util so enemies often won't actively seek them out.</p>
<p>Cons: They do no damage.
<br></br>
<p>- Smoke + Molotov</p>
<p>Pros: Can do damage and cut off an area like Smoke + Grenade but can do damage for a longer time, both can cut off an area.</p>
<p>Cons: $100 left on T, $0 left on CT, if you are dumb you might smoke your own molotov, wasting it.</p>
<br></br>
<p>- Grenade + Flash</p>
<p>Pros: Can blind and do damage if used in conjunction, can kill damaged players, can blind enemies, $300 left.</p>
<p>Cons: Both can be wasted.</p>
<br></br>
<p>- Molotov + Flash</p>
<p>Pros: Like HE + Flash but better as it does more damage.</p>
<p>Cons: $200 left on T, $100 left on CT. </p>
<br></br>
<p>WHAT IS THE BEST?</p>
<p>In my opinion, theyre all good in their own ways as they all have their upsides, however if you want a better pistol as well as utility, go with either Smoke + Flashbang or Grenade + Flashbang as they allow you to buy a P250 or Dual Berrettas. If you want to maximise impact on the round, go with Smoke + Molotov or Grenade + Molotov as they do damage and can cut off areas of the map during an execute. However, if you are going for kills (e.g. Lurk or Solo Queue), go with Flash + Grenade or Flash + Molotov as they are the best for getting easy frags.</p>
<br></br>
<p><u>UPGRADED PISTOLS</u></p>
<p>The BEST pistols are the P250 on T side and the Dual Berrettas on CT side. The DBs are a better version of the Glock (large mag, high firerate) and the P250 is a better version of the USP (one shot headshot, smaller mag, more accurate). That is why you shouldnt buy DBs on T side, because theyre a better version of the starting pistol, so buy util or armour instead. Same goes for CT side P250. *HOWEVER, DO NOT ALL BUY THE SAME THINGS ON PISTOL ROUND,* do this instead:</p>
<br></br>
<p>1-2 people minimum buy armour</p>
<p>2-3 people buy upgraded pistols and util</p>
<p>1 person buys util and kit</p>
<br></br>
<p><h2>2. Rules for buying (T & CT)</h2></p>
<p><u>T side:</u></p>
<p>1) When in doubt, just buy armour.</p>
<p>2) If 2 people have util, just buy armour.</p>
<p>3) If you want util, *make sure you have a plan* and let your team know what your plan is.</p>
<p>4) If you want to upgrade, only get the P250, nothing else.</p>
<br></br>
<p><u>CT side:</u></p>
<p>1) When in doubt, just buy armour.</p>
<p>2) Buy util with a purpose, but avoid buying molotovs.</p>
<p>3) Buy Dual Berrettas if you wish to upgrade our pistol.</p>
<p>4) Kits are not necessary, but not entirey unecessary (its just not a rule).</p>
